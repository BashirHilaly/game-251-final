# GAME 251 Final Project

# Introduction
This is a top down shooter game submitted for my Game251 Final taught by Professor Asim Khaliq. 

## Concept
The basic concept of the game is you play as an exterminator. You work for this multidimensional extermination company. You essentially explore these different environments to exterminate the pests. They start off small such as roaches and rats but eventually keep leveling up until you are met facing alien creatures and demons. Players have a limited amount of time to exterminate as many pests as possible. They have to use the many tools at their disposal and find creative ways to trap the pests.

## Gameplay Mechanics
The areas that players explore each provide varying difficulties and ever more dangerous pests. Using a time-based mechanism, the game challenges players to effectively eradicate creatures before the clock runs out. In order to prevail, players must tactically employ a variety of tools at their disposal, changing their strategy as they encounter increasingly formidable and varied opponents. Playing in multiplayer mode encourages friends to work together and compete, making for an exciting and dynamic gaming experience.
